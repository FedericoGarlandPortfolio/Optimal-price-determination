The aim of this project was to determine the optimal prices that maximize revenue and profit
for several retail products. For this purpose, demand models were obtained by fitting linear
models (Ordinary Least Squares and Poisson) that predict demand at different historical prices.
The models were then used to obtain revenue and profit functions which were differentiated
to obtain the optimal price that maximizes both metrics. Prices were considered for the
maximization of both revenue and profit because both can be business objectives depending
on the situation (e.g., revenue is more important than profit for initial market penetration and
growth).
